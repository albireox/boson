# Notes

- [This page](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-ui/blob/master/src/components/view/view-event-list.tsx) may contain a solution for scrolling to bottom in a stream using `react-window`.

- At some point we may want to migrate to [this](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). It provides better control of the build process, and the builds seem to be of smaller size, but it would require some rewriting and I don't love the directory structure it uses.
