# Introduction

Boson is a new observer graphical interface for the 2.5-metre [Sloan](https://sdss5.org) telescope.

The goal of Boson is to eventually replace the longstanding [STUI](https://github.com/ApachePointObservatory/stui) GUI with a new application that uses modern, standard technologies, and it's easier to maintain long-term.

## Technologies

Under the hood, Boson uses the the following libraries and frameworks:

- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) as the main programming language.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org) as a framework for creating native, cross-platform applications.
- [React](https://reactjs.org) for building interfaces.
- [MUI](https://mui.com) as a library of React components with a unified design.

## Support

Boson is developed and maintained in [GitHub](https://github.com/albireox/boson/). Issues can be reported [here](https://github.com/albireox/boson/issues).
