# Connecting

The first time you run Boson you'll need to define the connection parameters. That can be done by clicking on the menu bar **boson - Connect**. Once a connection is successful Boson will try to reconnect using the same credentials, which are stored in the system keychain.

If you need to log in as a different user first disconnect with **boson - Disconnect** and then reconnect from the menu bar.

## Main window alert

If Boson is disconnected or the connection fails you'll see an alert on the lower right seciton of the main window. If you press the `Reconnect` button on the alert Boson will try to reconnect using the last valid credentials. If that fails, the connect window will open.

## Preferences

The host, port, as well as the HTTP host and port can be defined in the preferences and will be used the next time the system connects.
